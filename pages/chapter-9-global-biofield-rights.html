                    The most intimate territory any human possesses is not the physical body alone, but the field
                    of biological information that animates it—heart rhythms, neural electrical patterns, biometric
                    signatures, emotional states. This biofield, once protected by the basic premise that our inner
                    biological processes are private, is now accessible through ubiquitous surveillance technologies.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Existing human rights frameworks were conceived when biological monitoring was limited to
                    medical contexts. They did not anticipate a world where our heartbeats become data points, our
                    emotional states become market commodities, and our neural patterns become training material
                    for artificial intelligence. The right to biological privacy must be explicitly recognized,
                    protected, and enforced at the global level.

                    This chapter proposes a comprehensive framework for global biofield rights—fundamental human
                    rights that protect biological sovereignty, establish clear boundaries for biometric data use,
                    and create enforceable remedies for violations. These rights are not new principles; they are
                    existing rights applied to new technological realities.

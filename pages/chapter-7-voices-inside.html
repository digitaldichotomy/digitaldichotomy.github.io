                    "It started with the smart boards. Our district installed them during COVID for 'hybrid learning.'
                    They had microphones, cameras, temperature sensors. We thought it was for attendance, for checking
                    if kids were paying attention. Then I got sick.

                    But my doctor—she's part of a research network—noticed patterns in my vitals. My heart rate,
                    stress levels, sleep patterns. They didn't match long COVID. They matched... something else.

                    "She showed me the data breach alert. Someone had accessed a database with my biometric
                    responses to the smart board system. Not just whether I was present. But my stress levels,
                    my engagement, my emotional state—measured through physiological responses to content
                    they were showing us. The company called it 'engagement analytics.' I call it violation.

                    to professional development companies, to the district itself to evaluate performance.

                    tell us. The company apologized, but they kept the data. They're still using it. I can't work.

                    on 'predictive student success algorithms.' They were using our biometric data to train AI.
                    Not just helping us—but studying us.

                    our stress patterns before exams, our attention during lectures, our emotional responses to
                    different subjects. They knew when we were lonely, when we were anxious, when we were depressed.

                    antidepressant counseling services. Not recommendations—predatory marketing.

                    I was declining. They got a court order for 'protective guardianship' based on algorithmic assessment.

## Voice Settings (Per Script)

| Script | Voice Type | Pace | Emphasis |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| 01-03 | Deep male, authoritative | 0.95x | Heavy on patent numbers |
| 04-06 | Neutral, investigative | 1.0x | Urgent on implications |
| 07-09 | Deep male, serious | 0.90x | Pause before reveals |
| 10 | Warm, personal | 1.0x | Emphasize "you/your" |

---

## Music Settings

**Recommended:** Ambient tech-thriller
- No lyrics
- 60-80 BPM
- Low in mix (15-20% volume)
- Build tension at 30s mark

**Avoid:**
- Upbeat/energetic (wrong tone)
- Heavy bass (distracts from voice)
- Sudden drops (breaks immersion)

---

## Visual Style Guide

**Use:**
- Patent document screenshots (zoom on key claims)
- Technical diagrams (architecture layers)
- Code snippets (monospace, high contrast)
- Simple animations (signal waves, data flows)
- Black/white/red color scheme

**Avoid:**
- Stock footage (looks generic)
- Faces (you're faceless, lean into it)
- Busy backgrounds (distracts from message)
- Overused tech imagery (matrix code, hoodies)

---

## Upload Schedule

**Optimal Times (EST):**
- Tuesday 11 AM - 1 PM
- Wednesday 11 AM - 1 PM
- Thursday 11 AM - 1 PM

**Frequency:**
- Weeks 1-2: 3 videos/week (test hooks)
- Weeks 3-4: 2 videos/week (double down on winners)
- Month 2+: 1-2 videos/week (sustainable)

---

## A/B Testing Framework

### Test Hooks First
Each script has 2 hook variations (Hook A / Hook B).

**Process:**
1. Upload Script 01 with Hook A
2. Upload Script 01 with Hook B (different day)
3. Compare 3-second hold rate
4. Kill loser, write new challenger

**Metrics That Matter:**
| Metric | Good | Great | Action |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| 3-second hold | 60%+ | 75%+ | Keep if 60%+ |
| 30-second retention | 40%+ | 55%+ | Keep if 40%+ |
| CTR (thumbnail) | 4%+ | 8%+ | Test new text if <4% |
| Engagement | 2%+ | 5%+ | Secondary metric |

**Kill Switch:**
- <50% 3-second hold after 3 uploads → Rewrite hook
- <30% 30-second retention after 3 uploads → Rewrite middle section
- <3% CTR after 3 uploads → New thumbnail text

---

## Thumbnail Text Guide

**File:** `thumbnail-text.md` contains 20 options

**Rules:**
- 4-7 words maximum
- ALL CAPS or Title Case
- High contrast (white/yellow on black)
- No full sentences
- Specific numbers > vague claims

**Examples:**
- ✅ "YOUR ROUTER WATCHES YOU BREATHE"
- ❌ "How WiFi routers can monitor your breathing patterns"
- ✅ "$650M SETTLEMENT FOR THIS"
- ❌ "Facebook's biometric privacy settlement explained"

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**File:** `hashtags.md` contains tiered sets

**Per Video:**
- 3 high-volume (1M+ posts)
- 3 mid-volume (100K-1M posts)
- 2 niche (<100K posts)

**Example Set:**
```
#technology #privacy #surveillance
#biometrics #dataprotection #digitalrights
#rPPG #wifisensing
```

---

## Script Format Legend

```
**bold** = AI voice emphasis (stress this word)
... = pause (0.5-1 second)
[BRACKET] = production note (don't read aloud)
CAPS = strong emphasis (use sparingly)
```

**Example:**
```
In **2024**... your WiFi router started watching you **breathe**.
Literally. [Pause for impact]

Not metaphorically. Not "collecting data." **Watching**. Your. **Chest**. **Rise**.
```

## Analytics Dashboard

**Track These Weekly:**

| Video | 3s Hold | 30s Retention | CTR | Likes | Comments | Shares |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| 01A | | | | | | |
| 01B | | | | | | |
| 02A | | | | | | |

**Win Conditions:**
- 3s Hold >70% AND 30s Retention >50% → Make Part 2
- CTR >8% → Use same thumbnail style
- Shares >10 → Topic has viral potential

---

## Content Iteration

**After 10 Videos:**
1. Identify top 3 performers (by 30s retention)
2. Identify bottom 3 performers
3. Analyze pattern (hook style? topic? thumbnail?)
4. Write next 10 scripts using winning patterns

**After 30 Videos:**
1. Compile all metrics
2. Identify your "signature style" (what your audience responds to)
3. Double down on that style
4. Consider spinning up themed series

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Generic hooks:** "Today we'll discuss..." → Viewer scrolls
✅ **Specific hooks:** "In 2024, your router started watching you breathe" → Viewer stops

❌ **Vague stakes:** "This affects privacy" → No urgency
✅ **Specific stakes:** "They know when you're home. When you're asleep. When you're having visitors." → Personal

❌ **Nameless enemies:** "A major tech company" → Feels like conspiracy
✅ **Named enemies:** "Meta. Google. Amazon." → Verifiable, credible

❌ **Weak CTAs:** "Learn more" → Forgettable
✅ **Strong CTAs:** "Free countermeasures at digitaldichotomy.github.io" → Specific, valuable

❌ **Flat delivery:** All sentences same length → Monotonous
✅ **Varied rhythm:** Short. Then long and building. Then short again. → Engaging

Digital Dichotomy investigates the architecture of covert surveillance technologies through verifiable patents, technical standards, and government documentation.

CORE TOPICS:
- Biometric surveillance patents (rPPG, gaze tracking, thermal emotion detection)
- Neural profiling and brain-computer interface technologies
- WiFi sensing and RF-based monitoring systems
- Digital Twin architecture and predictive modeling
- Privacy engineering countermeasures and defensive protocols
- Legal frameworks (BIPA, biometric privacy litigation)
- Cognitive sovereignty and biological autonomy

CONTENT APPROACH:
Evidence-based analysis only. Every claim references documented patents or technical specifications. No speculation. No conspiracy theories. Academic rigor meets actionable defense strategies.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Privacy researchers, civil liberties advocates, security professionals, policy makers, and individuals seeking to understand and protect against biometric surveillance infrastructure.

TONE:
Professional, investigative, educational. Similar to technical documentary narration - factual, measured, but urgent when warranted.

CONTENT PILLARS:
1. Patent breakdowns (specific technology analysis)
2. Legal warfare (litigation and settlements)
3. Countermeasures (actionable defense protocols)
4. Architecture explainers (how the layers connect)
5. Corporate accountability (who's building this)

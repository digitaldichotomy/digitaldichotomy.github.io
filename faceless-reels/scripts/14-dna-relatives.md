## Hook A (Test This First)

23andMe has your DNA. Ancestry has your DNA. And they shared it with **everyone**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what happened:

You spit in a tube. Sent it in. Got your **ethnicity report**. Your **health risks**. Your **ancestry breakdown**.

But you also gave them something else:

Your **genetic signature**. Your **family tree**. Your **relatives**.

[20s - Evidence]

**GEDmatch** - the database where you uploaded your raw DNA data?

Police used it to catch the **Golden State Killer**.

Sounds good, right?

Until you realize:

They didn't need **your** DNA.

They needed your **cousin's**. Your **uncle's**. Your **second cousin twice removed**.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slower, heavier]

You didn't consent to that.

Your relatives didn't consent to that.

But your DNA **implicates** all of them.

[55s - Build to close]

And here's what's coming:

**Insurance companies** using genetic risk data.

**Employers** screening for hereditary conditions.

**Governments** building genetic family trees.

[Final 10 seconds]

Your DNA isn't just yours.

It's your **family's**.

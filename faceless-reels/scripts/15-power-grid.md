# Script 15: Power Grid Knows When You're Home

**Duration:** 60 seconds  
**Word Count:** 145 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, exposé style, 1.0x pace  
**Music:** Industrial, subtle electrical hum

## Hook A (Test This First)

Your **power company** knows when you're home. When you leave. When you sleep.

And they **sell** that data.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Smart meters report your energy use every **15 minutes**. That's enough to track your entire life.

---

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what they can detect:

Your **TV** is on → you're in the living room.

Your **oven** is running → you're cooking dinner.

Your **shower** is heating → you're in the bathroom.

Your **power drops** at 11 PM → you're asleep.

[20s - Evidence]

This isn't speculation.

**Utility companies** have this data.

**Data brokers** buy this data.

**Advertisers** target based on this data.

[35s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct, heavier]

But here's what else they can do:

Detect when you're **away** (perfect time for burglary).

Detect when you're **asleep** (perfect time for surveillance).

Detect when you're **not home** (perfect time for a visit).

[50s - Build to close]

You thought you were paying for electricity.

You're paying for **surveillance**.

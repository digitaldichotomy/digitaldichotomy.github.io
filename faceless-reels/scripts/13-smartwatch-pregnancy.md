# Script 13: Your Smartwatch Knows You're Pregnant

**Duration:** 75 seconds  
**Word Count:** 175 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, intimate/serious, 0.95x pace  
**Music:** Subtle, personal (not corporate)

## Hook A (Test This First)

Your smartwatch knew you were **pregnant** before you did. And it sold that data.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Fitbit can detect pregnancy from your **heart rate variability**. 6 weeks early. They just never told you.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what they track:

Your **resting heart rate** changes during ovulation. Your **sleep temperature** shifts during implantation. Your **HRV** drops during early pregnancy.

All of this is measurable. **Continuously**. From your wrist.

Fitbit's patent US20190354033A1 describes this as "cycle tracking."

But here's what else it is:

[25s - Evidence]

**Pregnancy prediction**. **Fertility monitoring**. **Miscarriage detection**.

All without your **consent**. All without your **knowledge**.

And this data doesn't stay on your wrist.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Heavier tone]

Insurance companies **buy** this data.

Employers **license** this data.

Advertisers **target** based on this data.

[55s - Build to close]

You bought a fitness tracker.

You got a **reproductive surveillance device**.

[Final 10 seconds]

And the worst part?

You **paid** for it.

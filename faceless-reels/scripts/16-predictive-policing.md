## Hook A (Test This First)

Police algorithms predict where crime will happen. And they use **your** data to decide who's a suspect.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Palantir Gotham. PredPol. COMPAS. These algorithms decide who gets **stopped**. Who gets **searched**. Who gets **arrested**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's how it works:

**Step 1:** Police departments buy predictive software.

**Step 2:** Software ingests crime data. Arrest records. 911 calls. **Social media**.

**Step 3:** Algorithm identifies "high risk" individuals.

But here's the problem:

[20s - Evidence]

The data is **biased**.

Arrest records reflect **who gets caught**. Not who commits crimes.

911 calls reflect **who calls police**. Not where crime happens.

Social media reflects **who's monitored**. Not who's dangerous.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slower, heavier]

So the algorithm learns:

Poor neighborhoods = **more crime**.

Black neighborhoods = **more suspects**.

Protest movements = **more threats**.

[55s - Build]

And once you're in the system?

You get **stopped more**. Which generates **more data**. Which makes you **higher risk**.

It's a **feedback loop**.

And it's **legal**.

[70s - Direct close]

Palantir has contracts with **hundreds** of police departments.

PredPol is in **dozens** of cities.

COMPAS is used in **sentencing** across America.

[Final 10 seconds]

Your data is training their algorithms.

And you can't opt out.

## Production Notes

- **0-3s:** Police car lights, algorithm overlay
- **20s:** Show biased data sources (arrest records, 911, social)
- **40s:** Pattern interrupt - map with "high risk" zones highlighted
- **55s:** Feedback loop visualization (arrest → data → higher risk → arrest)
- **70s:** Palantir, PredPol, COMPAS logos
- **87s:** Website URL + "Predictive Policing" text

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Action if Below |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 3s Hold | 70%+ | Hook A should stop scroll |
| 30s Retention | 50%+ | Bias explanation should hold |
| CTR | 7%+ | Police + algorithm = controversial |
| Comments | 50+ | Will spark intense debate - moderate carefully |

## Hook A (Test This First)

In **2024**... your WiFi router started watching you **breathe**. Literally.

Not metaphorically. Not "collecting data." **Watching**. Your. **Chest**. **Rise**.

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Your WiFi router can see you through walls. **Without** cameras. **Without** microphones. **Without** your permission.

## Full Script (Use With Either Hook)

[HOOK A or B here]

It's called **WiFi Sensing**. Official standard: **802.11bf**. Finalized in **2024**.

Here's how it works: WiFi signals bounce off everything in your home. Walls. Furniture. **You**. When you move — even slightly — those signals **change**.

The new standard lets devices analyze those changes with enough precision to detect:

Your breathing pattern. Your heartbeat. Your location. **Room by room**.

A 2025 development called **Wi-Chat** uses AI to interpret this data. You can literally ask your router:

"How many people are in the room?"
"What's their breathing pattern?"
"Are they asleep?"

And it will **answer**.

[30s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slow down here]

This is being sold as home security. Wellness monitoring. But here's what they don't tell you...

Once your router knows when you're home... when you're asleep... when you're having visitors...

That data **gets used**.

Insurers use it. Employers use it. Law enforcement uses it.

The patent record shows this isn't speculation. It's **deployment**. Major router manufacturers are already integrating this.

[Final 10 seconds - Direct to camera energy]

Your router was supposed to give you internet.

Now it gives them **you**.

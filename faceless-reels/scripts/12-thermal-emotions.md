# Script 12: Thermal Cameras Read Your Emotions

**Duration:** 75 seconds  
**Word Count:** 180 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, serious/urgent, 0.95x pace  
**Music:** Dark, clinical tension

## Hook A (Test This First)

Thermal cameras can tell when you're **stressed**. When you're **aroused**. When you're **lying**.

And they're being installed **everywhere**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Qualcomm patented thermal emotion detection in **2019**. Patent **US20190354212A1**. It works. And it's deployed.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's how it works:

Your nose tip **cools** when you're stressed. Your cheeks **flush** when you're aroused. Your forehead **heats** when you're angry.

Thermal cameras detect these changes. **Microscopic** temperature shifts. From **meters away**.

Qualcomm's patent describes using this for "user authentication."

But here's what else you can do:

[25s - Evidence]

**Airport security** can see who's nervous.
**Retail stores** can see which products excite you.
**Employers** can see who's stressed during interviews.
**Police** can see who's "agitated" during stops.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct, heavier]

The military uses this for **interrogations**.

Border control uses this for **screening**.

Corporations use this for **hiring**.

[55s - Build to close]

And the technology is **not** experimental.

It's **patented**. It's **commercial**. It's **deployed**.

You walk past these cameras every day.

You just can't **see** them.

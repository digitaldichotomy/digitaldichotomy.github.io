## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Patent **US20210286433A1**. Apple. "Gaze-Based User Interaction."

It uses your front camera to track where your eyes focus. For how long. What makes you **look away**. What makes you **stare**.

**Microsoft** has the same tech. Patent US20180260539A1.

They can infer your **emotional state**. Your **cognitive load**. Your **attention span**.

[20s - Evidence]

Here's what they know:

Which ads make your pupils **dilate**. Which posts make you **look longer**. Which notifications you **ignore**.

Your gaze is a **signal**. And signals get **collected**.

[35s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slower, heavier]

But here's what they do with that data:

**Content algorithms** adjust based on where you look. **Ads** get optimized for eye contact. **Political posts** get prioritized if you can't look away.

[50s - Build to close]

And the scariest part?

You don't have to **click** anything. You don't have to **like** anything.

You just have to **look**.

**Duration:** 75 seconds  
**Word Count:** 170 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, concerned/parental, 0.95x pace  
**Music:** Subtle, concerning (not alarmist)

---

## Hook A (Test This First)

Schools are using AI to read students' **emotions**. During class. During tests. During **everything**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Affectiva. Proctorio. Respondus. These companies sell "emotion detection" to schools. Your kids are being scanned.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's how it works:

Student logs into **remote learning**.

Camera turns on. AI scans their **face**.

Detects **confusion**. Detects **boredom**. Detects **frustration**.

Teachers get **alerts**. Administrators get **reports**.

[20s - Evidence]

But here's what else it detects:

**Mental health struggles**. **Learning disabilities**. **Home stress**.

All without **parental consent**.

All without **student knowledge**.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Heavier, slower]

And this data doesn't stay at school.

It goes to the **vendors**.

Who sell it to **advertisers**.

Who build profiles on **your children**.

[55s - Build to close]

Your kid raised their hand in class.

Now they're in a **database**.

Categorized. Profiled. **Tracked**.

[Final 10 seconds]

This isn't education.

It's **surveillance**.

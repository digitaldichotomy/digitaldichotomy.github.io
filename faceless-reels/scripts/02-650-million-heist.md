## Hook A (Test This First)

**Facebook** paid **$650 million** for one thing: **your face**.

And they still have it.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

In 2021, Facebook agreed to pay **$650 million**. Not a fine. A **settlement**. For something so blatant they got caught **red-handed**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

The law they violated is called **BIPA**. Biometric Information Privacy Act. Passed in Illinois. **2008**.

It requires companies to get your **written consent** before collecting biometric data. Your face. Your fingerprints. Your retina scans.

Facebook's defense? They argued their "Tag Suggestions" feature was just analyzing **pixels**. Not **faces**. Just... pixels.

The court didn't buy it.

[15s - Evidence drop]

Here's what they were **actually** doing:

Every photo uploaded, their algorithm scanned **every face**. Extracted what they called a "face signature" — the distance between your eyes, the shape of your cheekbones, the ratio of your nose to your chin.

Then stored it in a database described as "**so large it dwarfs the FBI's**."

[30s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slower, heavier]

**1.6 million people** got paid. About **$345 each**.

But here's the math that should bother you:

Facebook had over **200 million users** in Illinois alone. They made **billions** from biometric data.

The settlement was a **rounding error**.

And they're not the only ones.

**TikTok** paid $92 million for the same thing.
**Google** has similar patents.
**Amazon** has similar patents.
**Apple** has similar patents.

[45s - Build tension]

They're all building the **same architecture**.

The question isn't whether your biometric data has been harvested.

It **has been**.

The question is: what are **you** going to do about it?

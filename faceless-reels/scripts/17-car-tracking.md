**Duration:** 75 seconds  
**Word Count:** 175 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, investigative, 1.0x pace

---

## Hook A (Test This First)

Your car records **everywhere** you've been. And it shares that data with **everyone**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Modern cars have **dozens** of sensors. GPS. Cameras. Microphones. They know more about you than your phone does.

---

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what your car tracks:

**GPS location** - everywhere you drive. Every stop. Every destination.

**Driving behavior** - how fast you accelerate. How hard you brake. Where you speed.

**Phone connections** - every device paired. Every call made. Every contact synced.

**Voice commands** - every destination you speak. Every call you make. Every song you request.

[25s - Evidence]

And here's who gets this data:

**Insurance companies** - for "usage-based" rates.

**Law enforcement** - via automatic license plate readers.

**Data brokers** - for targeted advertising.

**Manufacturers** - for "service improvements."

[45s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct, heavier]

But here's what they can do with it:

Prove you were at a **protest**.

Prove you visited a **clinic**.

Prove you met with **someone**.

[60s - Build to close]

Your car is a **tracking device**.

That you **bought**.

That you **drive every day**.

[Final 10 seconds]

And you can't turn it off.

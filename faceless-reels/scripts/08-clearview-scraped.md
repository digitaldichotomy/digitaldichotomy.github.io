## Hook A (Test This First)

**Three billion** faces. That's how many Clearview AI scraped. **Yours** is one of them.

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Clearview AI scraped your face from Facebook. From Instagram. From **every social media** you've ever used.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

They didn't ask. They didn't tell you. They just... **took** them.

Their technology creates what they call a "**face embedding**" — a mathematical representation of your face.

Upload a photo of you... and their system returns **every photo of you** they have. Every tag. Every mention. Every **appearance**.

[20s - Evidence]

Law enforcement uses it. Private investigators use it. **Corporations** use it.

And here's the thing:

You **can't opt out**.

You can't delete your face from their database. You can't request they stop using your biometric data.

Because they didn't get it from **you**.

They got it from **everyone who ever tagged you**.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct, heavier]

Illinois sued them. Under **BIPA**. They settled.

But the database **remains**.

[50s - Close]

Your face is now a **searchable index**.

**Forever**.

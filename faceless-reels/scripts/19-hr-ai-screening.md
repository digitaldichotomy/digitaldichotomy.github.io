## Hook A (Test This First)

AI decides if you get the **job**. And it's not looking at your **resume**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

HireVue. Pymetrics. Modern Hire. These platforms use AI to screen job applicants. Your facial expressions. Your voice. Your **micro-expressions**.

---

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what happens:

You apply for a job. You get invited to a "**video interview**."

You think a **human** will watch it.

They won't.

An **AI** will scan your face. Your voice. Your **word choices**.

[20s - Evidence]

It detects:

**Confidence** (or what looks like it).

**Enthusiasm** (or what algorithms think it is).

**Cultural fit** (or coded bias).

And then it gives you a **score**.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct, heavier]

But here's what it really detects:

**Nervousness** = "low confidence."

**Accent** = "poor communication."

**Disability** = "not a good fit."

[55s - Build to close]

Millions of people have been screened this way.

And they never knew.

And they can't **appeal**.

[Final 10 seconds]

Your next job application?

It's not human.

It's an **algorithm**.

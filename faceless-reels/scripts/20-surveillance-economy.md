## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Let me explain the **surveillance economy**:

**Step 1:** Companies give you "free" services.

Search. Social media. Email. Maps.

**Step 2:** You pay with **data**.

Every click. Every search. Every location. Every connection.

**Step 3:** They build **profiles**.

Not just what you do. Who you **are**. What you'll **buy**. How you'll **vote**.

[30s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Slower, heavier]

**Step 4:** They sell access.

Advertisers buy **targeting**.

Insurers buy **risk assessment**.

Employers buy **screening**.

Governments buy **surveillance**.

[50s - Build]

Here's the math:

**You** generate the data.

**They** keep the profit.

**You** get the ads.

**They** get the power.

[65s - Escalate]

This isn't a bug.

It's the **business model**.

Google's revenue: **$280 billion** per year.

Facebook's revenue: **$117 billion** per year.

Your data: **Priceless**.

[80s - Direct close]

And here's the thing about economies:

They grow. Or they **collapse**.

The surveillance economy is **growing**.

[Final 10 seconds]

The question is: how long will you let them use you?

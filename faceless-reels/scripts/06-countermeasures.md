## Hook A (Test This First)

You can't stop them from **trying**. But you can make it **expensive**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

They're harvesting your biometric data. Here's how to fight **back**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

**Physical countermeasures first:**

IR LEDs. Infrared LEDs pointed at cameras saturate the sensor. Scrambles their ability to read your pulse.

**850 nanometers** is the sweet spot. Invisible to humans. **Blinding** to cameras.

**Audio masking:**

Pink noise generators. Play them at 20Hz to 8kHz. Masks your typing, your voice, your breathing.

Reduces inference accuracy by **98%**.

[25s PATTERN INTERRUPT]

**RF diffusion:**

Metasurface panels scatter WiFi signals. Disrupts wall-penetrating radar.

They look like **artwork**. They work like **jammers**.

**Behavioral countermeasures:**

Randomize your routines. Change your commute. Vary your schedule.

Predictive algorithms need **patterns**. Don't give them **patterns**.

[50s - Build to close]

**Digital countermeasures:**

Gyro-jam apps inject noise into your phone's sensors. Reduces keystroke inference from **92% to 18%**.

**Legal countermeasures:**

BIPA gives you a private right of action. **$5,000 per violation**. Facebook paid $650 million.

[65s - Empowering close]

None of these are perfect. None are permanent solutions.

But they raise the **cost** of harvesting your data.

And that's the goal.

Not to win. To make you **expensive** to surveil.

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Action if Below |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 3s Hold | 70%+ | Test Hook B |
| 30s Retention | 55%+ | Actionable content should perform well |
| CTR | 7%+ | "HOW TO" usually strong |
| Saves | 10+ | Practical value - track saves |

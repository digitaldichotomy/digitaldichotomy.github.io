## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

The title: "Determining Physiological Characteristics for Content Delivery."

Translation: Using your device's camera to read your **heartbeat**... then showing you ads based on how your **body reacts**.

The technology is called **rPPG**. Remote photoplethysmography.

It detects color changes in your skin caused by blood flow. Changes so **subtle** you'd never notice them.

But a camera? It sees **everything**.

[20s - Evidence]

The patent describes a **feedback loop**:

Show you content. Measure your physiological response. **Adjust the content** to maximize engagement.

If your heart rate increases when you see a political post → show you more political posts.

If your skin temperature changes during an ad → that ad is **working**.

[35s PATTERN INTERRUPT]

And here's the kicker:

This isn't **experimental**.

The patent was **published in 2021**. The IEEE standards enabling it were **finalized in 2024**. The hardware to run this is **in your phone right now**.

[50s - Build to close]

Meta's not the only one.

**Apple** has similar patents.
**Google** has similar patents.
**Microsoft** has similar patents.

They're all building the **same architecture**.

[Final 10 seconds]

The only question is who deploys it **first**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Patent **20250359791**. Filed 2025. Published and active.

Your breath contains nitrogen dioxide. Ethanol. **Volatile organic compounds**. VOCs.

Microsoft's patent describes sensors that detect these chemicals... then use **machine learning** to correlate them with psychological states.

**Valence**. **Arousal**. **Stress**. **Depression**.

All predictable from what you **exhale**.

[25s PATTERN INTERRUPT]

The stated application? **Mental health monitoring**. Wellness. Taking care of you.

But here's what **else** you can do with emotion prediction:

Adjust content to maximize **engagement**. Show you ads when you're **vulnerable**. Time your notifications for **maximum impact**.

[50s - Build]

And breath is just **one input**.

Combine it with gaze tracking. Thermal imaging. Voice analysis.

And you don't need to ask how someone **feels**.

You **know**.

[60s - Direct close]

This patent wasn't filed in secret. It was **published**. **Openly**.

You can read it yourself.

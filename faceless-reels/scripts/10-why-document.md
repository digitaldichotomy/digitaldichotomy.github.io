# Script 10: Why I Document This

**Duration:** 60 seconds  
**Word Count:** 140 words  
**Voice:** Warm, personal, authentic, 1.0x pace  
**Music:** Minimal, hopeful (not dark)

---

## Hook A (Test This First)

People ask me why I spend **hundreds of hours** documenting surveillance patents. Why I don't just... **stop caring**.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Here's why I document this. Not to frighten you. To **equip** you.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's why:

**Knowledge is the first step to sovereignty**.

You can't defend against what you don't **understand**. You can't consent to what you don't **know exists**. And you can't regulate what happens in the **dark**.

[20s - Personal, slower]

Every patent I document is **public**. Every technology I describe is **verifiable**.

I don't speculate. I don't exaggerate. I don't **need** to.

The patent record **speaks for itself**.

[35s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Direct to viewer]

Some people call this conspiracy theory.

But patents aren't **theories**. They're **legal documents**. Filed by corporations. Reviewed by **governments**. Published **openly**.

[50s - Empowering close]

The architecture **exists**. The capabilities **exist**.

The question isn't whether this is **real**.

It **is**.

The question is: now that you **know**... what will **you** do?

[Final 5 seconds]

That's why I document this.

Not to frighten you.

To **equip** you.

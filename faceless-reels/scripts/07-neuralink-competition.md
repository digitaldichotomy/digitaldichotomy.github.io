# Script 07: Neuralink's Competition Is Scarier

**Duration:** 90 seconds  
**Word Count:** 220 words  
**Voice:** Deep male, serious/urgent, 0.90x pace  
**Music:** Dark, building dread

---

## Hook A (Test This First)

Neuralink requires **surgery**. Facebook's doesn't.

---

## Hook B (A/B Test Alternative)

Everyone knows about Neuralink. Implantable threads. Wireless brain data. Elon Musk.

The competition is **scarier**. And it's **optional**.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's what's **not** optional:

Facebook's non-invasive brain-computer interface. Patent **US20190388688A1**.

A wristband that detects neural signals. **No surgery**. No implants. Just wear it. Type with your **mind**.

EMG-based neural decoding. **Silent speech** recognition.

[20s - Evidence]

**Apple** has earbuds with EEG sensors. US20200155873A1.

They measure your brainwaves through your **ear canal**. Stated purpose? Health monitoring. Focus tracking.

**DARPA** is funding bidirectional neural interfaces. Reading **AND** writing to your brain.

Patent US20200349384A1. Military applications. Cognitive **enhancement**.

[40s PATTERN INTERRUPT - Heavier tone]

Neuralink requires surgery. That's a **barrier**.

But these? These are **consumer products**.

You buy them. You wear them. You don't even realize what they're **doing**.

[55s - Escalate]

And here's the thing about neural data:

It's not just what you **think**.

It's what you're **about** to think. Your **intentions**. Your **impulses**. Your **subconscious** responses.

[70s - Build to close]

Once they have that...

They don't need to **predict** your behavior.

They can **shape** it.

## Full Script

[HOOK A or B here]

Here's how: Your speaker **listens** to your breathing patterns while you sleep. Analyzes the audio for signs of respiratory distress.

If it detects **apnea events** — moments where you stop breathing — it can alert you.

Stated purpose? **Health monitoring**. Wellness. Taking care of you.

[20s - Pattern shift - darker tone]

But think about what this **normalizes**.

A device that listens to you **sleep**. That builds a profile of your most **vulnerable** moments. That knows when you're **unconscious**.

And once that capability exists... what **else** can it do?

[35s - Escalate]

Detect when you're having nightmares?
When you're talking in your sleep?
When there's **someone else** in the room?

The patent describes this as a **feature**.

But capabilities don't stay in their lanes. Technology **expands**. Use cases **multiply**.

[50s - Direct close]

Your speaker was already listening for its wake word.

Now it's listening for your **breathing**.

What's next?

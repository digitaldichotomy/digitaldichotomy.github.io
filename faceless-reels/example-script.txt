Okay so get this — in 2024, your WiFi router started watching you breathe. Like, actually watching. Your chest rising and falling. Through walls. In the dark.

I'm not kidding. And it's not a hack. It's an official international standard called IEEE 802.11bf. WiFi Sensing.

Here's how it works: WiFi signals bounce off everything in your home. Walls. Furniture. You. When you move — even slightly — those signals change. The new standard lets devices analyze those changes with enough precision to detect your breathing pattern. Your heartbeat. Your location. Room by room.

And here's the thing that should actually bother you: a 2025 development called Wi-Chat uses AI to interpret this data. You can literally ask your router "How many people are in the room?" or "What's their breathing pattern?" and it will answer.

This is being sold as home security. Wellness monitoring. But capabilities don't stay in their lanes. Once your router knows when you're home, when you're asleep, when you're having visitors — that data gets used. Insurers use it. Employers use it. Law enforcement uses it.

The patent record shows this isn't speculation. It's deployment. Major router manufacturers are already integrating this. Your router was supposed to give you internet. Now it gives them you.

Sometimes technology just... expands. And you don't get to opt out.

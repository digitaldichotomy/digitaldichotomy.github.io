# Data Pollution Cheat Sheet

## 20+ Techniques to Poison Your Digital Twin

### Temporal Jitter
- Randomize your daily routines by 15-30 minutes
- Use different devices at different times
- Vary your online activity patterns

### Behavioral Obfuscation  
- Mix in random searches unrelated to your interests
- Click on ads you don't care about occasionally
- Use different browsers for different activities

### Data Flood Methods
- Install browser extensions that generate fake browsing data
- Use VPN services that rotate your location
- Create multiple email accounts for different purposes

### Physical Protection
- Use Faraday bags for devices when not in use
- Cover cameras and microphones on laptops/phones
- Install RF shielding materials in your home

### Advanced Techniques
- Run virtual machines with fake user profiles
- Use cryptocurrency for financial privacy
- Employ steganography for secure communications

## Implementation Priority
1. Start with temporal jitter (easiest)
2. Add behavioral obfuscation (medium difficulty)  
3. Implement physical protection (requires investment)
4. Advanced techniques (for high-risk individuals)

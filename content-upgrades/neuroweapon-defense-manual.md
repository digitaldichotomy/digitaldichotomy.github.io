# Neuroweapon Defense Manual

## Protecting Against Remote Neural Influence

## Understanding the Threat
- Pulsed RF energy weapons
- Through-wall monitoring systems
- Cognitive influence technologies
- Biofield manipulation methods

## Detection Methods
### Physical Symptoms
- Unexplained headaches
- Sleep pattern disruptions
- Mood changes without cause
- Visual or auditory anomalies

### Technical Detection
- RF spectrum analyzers
- EMF meters
- Thermal cameras
- Audio spectrum analysis

## Defense Strategies

### Immediate Protection
1. **Faraday Shielding**
   - Create Faraday cage for sleeping area
   - Use metallic window films
   - Install RF blocking paint

2. **Signal Jamming** 
   - White noise generators
   - RF jammers (where legal)
   - Frequency hopping devices

3. **Physical Barriers**
   - Metallic window screens
   - RF reflective materials
   - Grounded metal mesh

### Long-term Protection
1. **Relocation Strategies**
   - Move away from urban centers
   - Choose locations with minimal EM pollution
   - Underground or shielded living spaces

2. **Lifestyle Changes**
   - Reduce electronic device usage
   - Practice mental discipline techniques
   - Build community awareness networks

## Legal Protections
- Document all incidents
- File complaints with FCC
- Seek legal counsel for harassment
- Contact civil liberties organizations

## Recovery Methods
- Medical evaluation and treatment
- Psychological support
- Community support networks
- Technical counter-surveillance
